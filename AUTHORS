SCtrlTP was originally created in 2009 at Electronic Vision(s) Group,
Kirchhoff-Institute for Physics, Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg,
Germany.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, added translations, helped
answer newbie questions, and generally made SCtrlTP that much better:

	Moritz Schilling, the main author
	Eric Müller
	Christian Mauch
